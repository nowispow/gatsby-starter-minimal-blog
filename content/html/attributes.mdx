Some tags, like link tags, have attributes that help specify their behavior. Link tags are required to have the `href` attribute to identify the page being linked to. Another set of tags, the `<meta>` tag, get their functionality entirely from attributes. Each page has several of them in the `<head>` section of its HTML. Their purpose ranges from identifying search information about the page to even specifying how the page will display on social networks.
